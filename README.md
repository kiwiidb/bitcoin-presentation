BTC transactions and the Lightning Network

This presentation is meant as a technical explanation on how The Lightning Network works. 
It starts with how regular bitcoin-transactions work, then explains the construction of a Poon-Dryja payment channel
and finally explains how HTLC's work. It deliberately doesn't go into much detail over mining and other stuff.
If I have made a horrible mistake somewhere, please submit a pull request. :)
